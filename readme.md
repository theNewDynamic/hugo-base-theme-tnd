# [wip] A Base theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a framework for building websites.

A base theme for Hugo sites. Though it looks like a theme, the intent is to provide a solid starting place for Hugo sites and include best practices for performance, A11y, and rapid development.

It's subject to change quite a bit at this point.
